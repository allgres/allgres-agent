-- Allgres 0.1.0-alpha.1 control plane.
--
-- Internal state lives in the allgres_private/allgres_public schemas and the
-- allgres_owner role; user-facing native functions are exposed under schema
-- allgres.
--
-- This file is the single canonical definition of the control plane's core
-- (sections 1-8 below). Every object is defined exactly once, in
-- dependency order; there are no superseded copies left behind by earlier
-- migrations. The file is idempotent (CREATE OR REPLACE, IF NOT EXISTS,
-- ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING), so a fresh install can replay it safely. Alpha
-- releases require a fresh database until an upgrade contract is published.
--
-- Sections 9-14 (the operator API, seed data, selftest, grants, the
-- allgres facade + dashboard RPC, and the final ownership pass) live in
-- six other files instead -- split out once this file alone grew large
-- enough to trip rustc's compile-time expansion limit on the pgrx macro that
-- embeds it. All seven files are loaded in this exact order
-- (src/lib.rs's extension_sql_file! calls, chained
-- with `requires` so pgrx enforces it regardless of declaration order) --
-- together they behave as exactly one file always has: any of them can
-- forward-reference anything in an earlier one (a PL/pgSQL function body
-- is never validated against the catalog until it is actually called,
-- long after every file has finished loading), and the ownership-fixing
-- pass/REVOKEs in the last file correctly find every function every
-- earlier file defines because each one is required to load before it.
--

-- 1. Roles.  Invariant 7: three runtime roles.  allgres_owner is deploy-only.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- allgres_owner is a pure object-owner role -- NOLOGIN (nobody connects as
-- it directly; the installer connects as a superuser or an equivalent
-- deploy identity, and everything this file creates ends up owned by
-- allgres_owner via the ownership-transfer block in "12. Grants") and
-- NOINHERIT (it grants nothing to anyone by virtue of membership; every
-- grant below is explicit). allgres_role_admin is deliberately a *separate*
-- role, not folded into allgres_owner, and owns exactly one function
-- (fn_provision_agent_role, the only thing in this file that runs a
-- dynamic CREATE ROLE): giving allgres_owner CREATEROLE so that one
-- function could dynamically provision agent roles would hand every other
-- SECURITY DEFINER function in this file that same power too, since they
-- would all share the same owner -- a bug or an unreviewed future change
-- in any one of them would have it. Scoping CREATEROLE to the one role
-- that owns exactly the one function that needs it keeps that blast radius
-- to that one function.

  -- fn_llm_complete (via `sandbox`, below), so its own privilege -- unlike
  -- everything else `sandbox` can reach -- must live in a role that owns

-- Prefers the caller's actual PostgreSQL role identity over the

-- fn_provision_agent_role) is running sandboxed SQL as that role, and
-- current_user is PostgreSQL's own session state, not a value this or any
-- other function has to trust a GUC for.
--
-- Deliberately SECURITY INVOKER and table-free (the agent_id is parsed
-- straight back out of the role name -- fn_provision_agent_role only ever
-- names one 'allgres_agent_' || <uuid with dashes stripped>, so this is
-- exactly reversible) rather than looking it up in allgres_private.agents.
-- The reason is not the schema grant (that could be solved with
-- SECURITY DEFINER, same as everywhere else in this file) but something
-- SECURITY DEFINER cannot solve here: it changes current_user for the
-- rest of that function's execution, to the function's *owner*, not the
-- original caller -- and that change is in effect for anything called
-- from inside it too, security definer or not. agent_may_read is already
-- SECURITY DEFINER (it has to be, to read allgres_private.permissions and
-- sql_sandbox_allowlist); calling this function from inside agent_may_read
-- would see current_user as agent_may_read's owner on every single call,
-- never the querying agent's own role -- confirmed live: that was this
-- function's first version, and every agent's own grants resolved as
-- "no permission" against its own view. So this stays SECURITY INVOKER,
-- and every caller (see v_sales / v_my_tasks below) calls it directly,
-- before crossing into agent_may_read's SECURITY DEFINER boundary, not
-- from inside it -- current_user is only ever the real caller up to the
-- point something SECURITY DEFINER runs, never past it.
--
-- The GUC path stays as a fallback for an agent that predates per-agent
-- roles and still runs sandboxed SQL as the one shared `sandbox` role --
-- see fn_run_sandboxed_sql's caller in src/lib.rs for how that GUC gets
-- set. GUCs do not have the SECURITY DEFINER problem above: a value set
-- with set_config(..., true) survives a role or security-context change
-- for the rest of the transaction, which is exactly why the original
-- design used one instead of current_user in the first place.

-- 6. SQL sandbox.
--
-- What an agent statement is allowed to touch is decided from PostgreSQL's own
-- parse tree (allgres.analyze_sql -> raw_parser), not from pattern matching the
-- statement text.  The previous regex layer had to re-implement lexing, and
-- comment injection, quoted identifiers, comma joins and `extract(x FROM y)`
-- were all ways for it to be wrong in one direction or the other.
--
-- A note on the `sandbox` role, because the obvious design does not work:
-- PostgreSQL refuses `SET ROLE` inside a security-definer function ("cannot set
-- parameter \"role\" within security-definer function", SQLSTATE 42501), and the
-- restriction covers the whole call stack below one.  This function is
-- SECURITY DEFINER (it needs to read allgres_private.permissions and pg_proc
-- regardless of who is asking), so it cannot itself drop to an unprivileged
-- role.  Earlier versions of this file tried anyway and turned the failure
-- into "sandbox role unavailable", which meant execute_sql never worked at
-- all.
--
-- The fix is the split below: this function only validates and returns the
-- normalized statement text; it executes nothing.  The runtime worker queues
-- that text in allgres_private.sql_calls (fn_claim_sql / fn_complete_sql, the
-- same claim/complete shape the outbound HTTP pump uses for LLM and function
-- calls), then runs it as a *top-level* SPI statement -- issued directly by
-- the worker, not nested inside any SECURITY DEFINER function -- where
-- `SET LOCAL ROLE sandbox` is legal.  See allgres_public.fn_run_sandboxed_sql
-- below and src/lib.rs's `run_sandboxed_sql`.
--
-- Layering, strongest first:
--   a. the statement only ever executes as `sandbox`, never as this
--      function's owner;
--   b. search_path = pg_temp, so an unqualified relation name cannot resolve
--      to anything at all;
--   c. the views themselves return no rows unless the current agent holds the
--      matching permission (allgres_private.agent_may_read), so authorisation
--      does not depend on the analysis below being complete;
--   d. transaction_read_only + statement_timeout, both real now that
--      execution is a top-level statement instead of nested inside one;
--   e. only non-volatile functions, checked against pg_proc — volatility is
--      what separates a read from a side effect;
--   f. the parse tree must be exactly one non-writing SELECT;
--   g. every relation it names must be schema-qualified, outside the reserved
--      schemas, and in allowlist n per-agent permission.

  -- from Rust, not just this one nested step, risking a false cancel on

-- already erased that from the role system -- see run_procedure_call's own
-- comment -- so the procedure author names a provider/model explicitly,
-- the same way http_get's URL or mcp_call's tool name is fixed at

-- logged into execution_logs or outbound_calls the way a turn's own LLM
-- call is -- it is a Procedure's own internal utility call, not a step in
-- the visible agent/LLM conversation, and (see KNOWN_ISSUES.md's Phase 3e
-- entry) its cost is not yet attributed to any schedule's spent_cost_usd
-- budget, a known gap for a later slice if this path sees real use.
--
-- A network-level failure (bad status, timeout, unparsable body) comes
-- back as {"ok": false, "error": ...} rather than an exception, so a
-- Procedure's own body can branch on it with a plain IF -- a
-- misconfigured p_llm_config (no such provider, provider disabled, no
