-- Allgres 0.1.0-alpha.1 control plane -- sections 12-14: grants, the allgres facade
-- + dashboard RPC, and the final ownership pass.
--
-- Split out of sql/control_plane.sql alongside sql/selftest.sql once that
-- single file grew large enough to trip a real rustc compile-time safety
-- lint on the pgrx macro that embeds it (KNOWN_ISSUES.md item 38). Loaded
-- last (src/lib.rs's extension_sql_file! declares `requires =
-- ["selftest"]`, transitively after sql/control_plane.sql too): section
-- 12's REVOKEs and its own ownership-fixing catalog scan need every
-- function from both earlier files to already exist, and section 14's
-- final ownership pass needs literally everything -- the entire reason it
-- runs last.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 12. Grants.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Every schema, table, view, sequence, and SECURITY DEFINER function this
-- file creates is owned by allgres_owner (fn_provision_agent_role alone
-- excepted -- see "1. Roles" for why it is owned by allgres_role_admin
-- instead), not by whichever superuser happened to run CREATE EXTENSION.
-- Ownership was never actually reassigned before this -- confirmed live,
-- an external review caught it: every schema and every SECURITY DEFINER
-- function in a fresh install was owned by the installing superuser, which
-- means the "four fixed roles" README describes were three real
-- boundaries and one that did nothing (allgres_owner existed but owned
-- nothing, so SECURITY DEFINER meant "runs as whoever installed this," not
-- "runs as a role scoped to exactly what this file grants it"). Iterates
-- rather than naming every object by hand, so it stays correct as objects
-- are added; idempotent (ALTER ... OWNER TO is a no-op when already
-- correct), so replaying this on every install/upgrade is free. Must run
-- after every object above has been created, and before the grants below
-- (a GRANT does not depend on ownership, but keeping the two together
-- keeps this section legible as "how access to these schemas actually
-- works," start to finish).
-- Scoped to actual members of the 'allgres' extension (pg_depend, deptype
-- 'e') rather than "everything currently sitting in these three schema
-- namespaces" -- a second-round review pointed out the blanket version
-- would silently take ownership of any unrelated object a user happened to
-- create inside allgres_private/allgres_public/allgres, which has nothing
-- to do with this extension. CREATE EXTENSION (and ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE,
-- which keeps the same pg_extension row) automatically records every
-- object this file creates as an extension member as it creates it, so
-- this scoping needs no separate bookkeeping of its own.

-- 14. Final ownership pass.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- "12. Grants" runs its ownership-transfer pass before this section exists --
-- on a fresh install, allgres.create_agent/create_session/pump/
-- assume_worker_role/dashboard_rpc and the allgres.agents/tasks/projects
-- views are all created after that pass already ran, so they were never
-- caught by it and stayed owned by whichever superuser ran CREATE
-- EXTENSION -- confirmed live by a second-round review, then reproduced
-- here: a fresh install left exactly those objects, and no others, owned
-- by the installer instead of allgres_owner. An upgrade from a real 0.2.0
-- install did not show this, since those objects already existed (under
-- their old owner from that install's own history) before this file's
-- ownership pass ran at all -- fresh-install-only bugs like this are
-- exactly what testing only the upgrade path misses.
--
-- Same logic as "12. Grants", not duplicated by hand: literally the same
-- extension-membership-scoped, idempotent pass, run again now that every
-- object in the file (this section included) actually exists. A no-op for
-- anything the first pass already caught.
