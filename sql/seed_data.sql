Never change what the target agent is supposed to accomplish -- only how
cheaply it gets there. If you find nothing worth changing, use final_answer
to say so.

You also own a narrower, function-scoped version of the same idea: any
procedure_function a turn was dispatched through can carry its own model
override, cheaper than whatever the calling agent's own llm_config uses for
its turns in general (see allgres_public.v_function_model_experiments -- read it
with execute_sql). A function with no override yet, or one you think could run
on something cheaper, is a candidate: propose
{"action":"propose_change","target_function_id":"...","op":"start_experiment","candidate_provider":"...","candidate_model":"...","canary_percent":N,"reason":"..."}
to trial it on a small share (canary_percent) of that function's real traffic
without touching the rest. Once a running experiment has at least its
min_sample_size, compare candidate_success_rate against baseline_success_rate
on the same view and propose either
{"action":"propose_change","target_function_id":"...","op":"promote","experiment_id":"...","reason":"..."}
(candidate held up) or the same shape with "op":"reject" (it did not) --
never promote on a smaller sample than min_sample_size, and never propose a
second start_experiment for a function that already has one running.

-- 10b. Extension configuration tables -- which of this extension's own
--      tables `pg_dump` includes data for, and on what terms.
--
-- By default `pg_dump` excludes ALL data belonging to an extension's own
-- objects: schema only, regenerated fresh by `CREATE EXTENSION` on restore.
-- Every table below holds real operator/agent state that `CREATE EXTENSION`
-- does not regenerate, so without this a logical backup (`pg_dump`) of this
-- database would restore to a working, EMPTY install -- every agent,
-- session, task, policy, log, and secret silently gone, with no error
-- anywhere to say so. Confirmed live before this was added: a real agent,
-- session, and task, dumped with `pg_dump -Fc` and restored into a fresh
-- cluster, came back with none of it -- only the seed data below. See
-- KNOWN_ISSUES.md, "backup/PITR drill", for the full account and the fix
-- verified afterward. Physical backup (`pg_basebackup` / PITR) has no such
-- gap -- it copies the actual data files -- this is specific to logical
-- (`pg_dump`) backup.
--
-- Tables with no seed rows at all dump unconditionally. The tables section
-- 10 above seeds (llm_providers, sql_sandbox_allowlist, and
-- agents/policies/permissions for the built-in 'analyst', 'general', and
-- 'health_monitor' agents plus the six is_system=true system agents from
-- 10a-2, plus demo_sales for 'analyst' alone)
-- exclude exactly those seeded rows: the extension script recreates them
-- fresh on every install, and dumping them too would try to INSERT a
-- second copy on top and fail on the same UNIQUE constraint that makes
-- them idempotent to begin with. The one real cost of that exclusion: an
-- operator's own edit to a *built-in* provider row (base_url, is_enabled,
-- allow_private_network, a stored secret) does not survive a
-- `pg_dump`-based restore -- only a wholly new provider row would; a
-- physical backup has no such limit. `sql_function_allowlist` and
-- `oauth_states` are deliberately not registered here: every row in the
-- former is exactly what the extension script itself inserts (see
-- KNOWN_ISSUES, "SQL sandbox function check" -- nothing beyond the seed
-- can exist there today), and the latter holds only short-lived
-- in-progress OAuth flow state that is stale within minutes regardless of
-- backup. `oauth_calls` *is* registered, unconditionally, the same as
-- outbound_calls/sql_calls: unlike oauth_states it is an audit trail of
-- exchange attempts an operator may want to keep, and unlike llm_secrets it
-- never holds a plaintext secret or token to begin with (fn_claim_oauth
-- injects the client secret only into its in-memory response to the
-- worker; fn_complete_oauth never writes a response body back into this
-- table -- there is no response_body column on it at all, only a status
-- code and, on failure, the provider's error text).
