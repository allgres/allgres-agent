//! Allgres native runtime.
//!
//! Two background workers, neither of which owns any agent state:
//!
//!   `allgres runtime`  SPI thread + a pool of HTTP threads.  The SPI thread
//!                      only ever runs short transactions (pump, RPC); every
//!                      blocking network call happens on a pool thread, so a
//!                      slow LLM can never stall the dashboard.  Sandboxed
//!                      agent SQL also runs here, on the SPI thread, since it
//!                      needs SPI: PostgreSQL's SET ROLE restriction means it
//!                      can only be a top-level statement issued directly by
//!                      this worker, never nested inside a SECURITY DEFINER
//!                      function -- see `run_sandboxed_sql`.
//!
//!   `allgres web`      HTTP listener.  No SPI at all: it forwards to the
//!                      runtime worker over a unix socket.  One thread per
//!                      connection, bounded, so a slow client cannot stall the
//!                      accept loop either.
//!
//! All SQL is executed with bound parameters.  Nothing in this file builds a
//! statement by concatenating a value into a string.  `run_sandboxed_sql`
//! passes agent-generated SQL to Postgres as a bind parameter too; the one
//! place it gets wrapped into a larger statement by concatenation is
//! sql/control_plane.sql's `fn_run_sandboxed_sql`, and only after
//! `fn_validate_sql` has confirmed it parses as exactly one non-writing
//! SELECT, which is what makes that safe.
