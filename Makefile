# Wraps cargo-pgrx so building allgres from source is the same two
# commands as any other native Postgres extension: `make` then `make
# install` (`sudo` prepended if the extension directories need it -- see
# the `install` target below). Nothing here replaces
# `cargo pgrx <subcommand>` directly -- it only detects the one locally
# installed PostgreSQL version and the cargo-pgrx version this crate is
# pinned to, so neither has to be typed by hand every time.
#
# `make quickstart` goes one step further and actually runs the thing --
# against the `postgres` database, using the no-restart install path
# (docs/deployment/source-install.md, "Installing without a restart")
# rather than editing postgresql.conf. Kept separate from `install` on
# purpose: `install` only ever touches this machine's Postgres
# *installation* (files under
# pg_config's own lib/share dirs, same as any extension's own `make
# install`); `quickstart` is the one target that touches a live database,
# so it stays a deliberate, separate step rather than a side effect of
# building the extension.

# The flip side, hit live: running plain `make install` as a non-root
# *service* account (the `postgres` system user itself, cargo/cargo-pgrx
# installed under its own $HOME) makes this add `--sudo`, and cargo-pgrx
# then shells out to a real interactive `sudo cp` per file -- which can
# have no valid password to satisfy at all, since that account's own
# login is typically locked/nologin. Prefer running the entire `make
# install` as root to begin with (so this branch takes the empty-string
# path and cargo-pgrx never needs its own nested sudo call):
#   sudo env "PATH=$PATH" make install
# preserving PATH so root's shell still finds cargo/cargo-pgrx/pg_config
# wherever the non-root account's own install put them.
